    <h2> Who Am I</h2>
    <p>I'm a student at summit. Ive tooken a course in HTML freshman year it was fun. I learned how to put a website on the internet through a server host called filezilla. I am also teaching myself to play guitar becuase playing the guitar is cool. I find it an interesting instrument. Its hard there are some chords I just cant get right. I also yell at people on GTA V especailly the ones who have not reached the age of playing that game. I like collecting cassettes little action figures the one from vending machines my favorite movie is Deliverance and my favorite book is Psycho because it is better than the movie</p>
